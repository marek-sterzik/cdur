# ![C.dur.](cdur.svg)

_C.dur._ is a JavaScript library providing durable components for React. _C.dur._ creates components similar to standard React stateful components (declared as classes), but _C.dur._ components are **durable**. The lifetime of a _C.dur._ component is independent on the React rendering process.

Therefore _C.dur._ components are useful for handling asynchronous requests. _C.dur_ provides a simple way, how to deal with asynchronicity in React.

** This is the very initial commit of the library. Documentation needs to be added. **
## Basic usage

```jsx
import Cdur from "cdur"
```
